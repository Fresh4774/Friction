        "...he is a phenomenon. I remember teaching him when he was in 8th grade, and he would say, 'Sir, this stuff is pretty easy.' Honestly, he is the BEST prodigy I've ever come across. As surprising as it may sound, he knows more about FullStack Development than I do, and I am happy to learn from him... hopefully, he will tutor my kids in the near future."
